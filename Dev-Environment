The following needs to be done to develop or run the code for this analysis:

sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
sudo easy_install virtualenv
sudo easy_install pip
sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper

export WORKON_HOME=~/.virtualenvs
mkdir -p $WORKON_HOME
source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
mkvirtualenv default

cd androguard
python setup.py bdist_egg
cd dist
easy_install androguard-1.5-py2.7.egg
