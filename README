Initial Thesis Development:

V 0
1.Each APK file will be compresed using zip. The size will be checked.

2.APK1 and APK2 will be concatonated and zip will be run on this 
single file. 

if APK1 not equal APK2
   zip_size(APK1||APK2) > zip_size(APK1)+zip_size(APK2))

if zip_size(APK1|APK2) == zip_size(APK1) + zip_size(APK2) 
   then APK1 ~ APK2  "same"

so if the above holds we want d(APK1,APK2)=0

d(APK1,APK2)=|zip_size(APK1,APK2)|/zip_size(APK1)+zip_size(APK2)=1

File:		   APK1,APK2, ... ,M_n

Date of Appearance:d_1<=d_2<=...<=d_n

I would pick a T for threshold and feed each file into it to get 
a Forest
