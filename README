MEDS: Malware Evolution Discovery System


This framework achieves the following two tasks:

1. It creates phylogenetic trees of malware samples. A phylogenetic tree shows the evolution of a malware sample. 

2. It makes predictions of generative malware. Generative malware is malware that gives rise to other malware samples.

The main goal of this framework is to allow malware researchers tackle the malware problem by first using a visual tool, phylogenetic trees, to find out 
clusters of malware samples and to make predictions via machine learning about generative malware.
