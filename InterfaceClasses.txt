IMalware - a piece of malware, together with a discovery date (and uncertainty in the date?)
	   This can be an object MyAPK which inherits from APK in androguard.
	   APK gives the advantage of retrieving data from the APK file.
	   How can we define a date for a sample?
	   The following are some ideas:
	   1. Extract the creation date. Via metadata from the zipfile?
	   2. Extract the date from VirusTotal to see when was the first time the sample was detected in the wild.
	   
	   *Note:
	   I can use the following:
	     import zipfile
	     zip = zipfile.ZipFile('sample_infected')
	     zipobject=zip.getinfo('AndroidManifest.xml')
	     zipobject.date_time
